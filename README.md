# ASF stargazer

This was just a fun little project for tracking stars on one of our GH projects. It was originally written with angular but
for educational purposes it's now rewritten with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).

Don't forget to run `bower install`. By default stargazer uses the compiled react files, but in index.html you can uncomment the development files instead.
